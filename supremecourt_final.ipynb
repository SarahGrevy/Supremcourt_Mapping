    "## Supreme Court Project Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal of this project is to build a database of Supreme Court cases for 2020 (or a different range of years) that includes the dialogue from the oral arguments of each case. As we have seen in class the arguments were scraped from this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx \n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can follow that guide to downloading and transforming pdfs to texts (don't be shy on slack!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a folder of texts transcripts there are three primary programmatic steps that you need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** Step 3 is the most challenging--if you want to spend some time coding, you can skip Steps 1 and 2 and get to work on Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 1:** scrape all of the case information available on this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2020\n",
    "\n",
    "This should include case name, docket number, etc--and most importantly the name of the PDF file. All of the text files share the exact same name as the PDF files they came from. This file name will allow you to connect your transcription data with your case data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to you what kind data structure you want to build. But it likely to be a list of lists, or list of dictionaries--for each case you will have a list or dictionary of the information you scrape from the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 2:** find secondary source(s) to scrape/integrate with your case data. The information on the Supreme Court page is very limited. You need to find a source or group of sources that ad information. The most important information would likely be: the decision, who voted for and against, and the district court origin of the case (for geocoding). You might think of other great things to put in there too! This information needs to be merged with the data you have from STEP 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 3:** use regular expressions to clean up and parse the text files so that you have a searchable data structure containing the dialog from the transcripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Architecture** \n",
    "You will need to think about how you will set up, separate, and join different tables that you create. The initial scraping will give you very simple dataframe: the columns will be dockett, case name, date argued, and PDF name. The regex work on the PDFs should result in a very simple table (or just a list of tuples) of speaker name and dialogue. \n",
    "\n",
    "`[('MR. BERGERON',\" Yes. That's essentially the same thing\"),('JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR',' So how do you deal with Chambers?')]`\n",
    "\n",
    "But make sure you attach the docket number or pdf filename to each set of arguments you transform using regex. Your secondary sources and information should be linked by docket number, but the question is how to set up those data frames, join them, aggregate them, and narrow them to the fields necessary for presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go step-by-step through this, and DM me on Slack whenever you get stuck, and I will help. If you complete all the steps before Friday, Slack me if you want to go further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretive Architecture**\n",
    "Also consider what kind of interpretive categories you can add through your reading and research. At the very least, it is recommended that you come up with categories for the kinds of cases that are before the court: human clustering for meaning is always more effective than computational clustering. Try to come up with perhaps 8 to 10 domains that groups of cases might belong to. But also think of other ways of categorizing these cases or these decisions--by politics, by consequences on citizens (you could make a scale from 1 to 10), even an aggregated index of consequences/effects on different types of communities, sectors, regions, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are the researcher, these categories or ways of expressing your point-of-view.\n",

       "      <td>Mr. Chief Justice, and   may it please the Court:   Our fundamental submission in this   case is that in defining \"Indian Tribe\" for ISDA   purposes, Congress did not deliberately include   Alaska native regional and village corporations   only to then exclude all of them by subjecting   them to a formal political recognition   requirement that no ANC meets or, indeed, has   ever met.   Instead, the settled understanding for   the last 45 years has been that ANCs are   eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA   purposes, even though ANCs are not and have   never been federally recognized Indian Tribes.   That interpretation has been endorsed by all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Official - Subject to Final Review    three branches of the federal government.   Congress was acting against the   backdrop of those settled understandings when it   incorporated the ISDA definition of \"Indian   Tribe\" into the CARES Act in 2020.  Congress   chose to make ANCs eligible to receive millions   of dollars of coronavirus relief funds to   benefit the many Alaska natives whom they serve.   The decision below contravenes that   policy judgment and threatens to shut ANCs out   of a wide range of important federal programs.   No sound principle of textual interpretation   justifies such a dramatic departure from the   status quo.  Reading the ISDA definition to mean   that ANCs are included only in the event that   they are someday somehow recognized by the   United States for government-to-government   relations would render their deliberate   inclusion in the statute a dead letter.  Either   the recognition clause must mean something else,   or it does not apply to ANCs.   Now we principally urge the latter   approach, which the Department of the Interior   and the Indian Health Service adopted decades   ago and which the Ninth Circuit endorsed in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Official - Subject to Final Review   Cook Inlet case.   In our view, Congress defined the   entities eligible to enter into ISDA agreements   as federally recognized Indian Tribes and also,   in addition, the entities that play a similar   role in the special case of Alaska, namely,   Alaska native villages and Alaska native   corporations defined in and established pursuant   to ANCSA. That reading, unlike Respondents'   reading, gives effect to every word and clause   in the statute.   I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

In Hayes, the Court was   considering a statutory definition of the term   \"misdemeanor\" -- \"domestic misdemeanor violence\"   -- or, sorry, \"misdemeanor crime of domestic   violence,\" and the -- the statutory definition   there had a prefatory clause and then two   subsections, and the question before the Court   was how to apply a modifier in the second   subsection.   And based on textual and contextual   evidence, the Court concluded that the modifier   that appeared in the second subclause of that   definition actually applied to its -- its   antecedent was one of the words in the prefatory   clause at the beginning of the definition.   And we think we're asking the Court   here for -- for an even less sort of -- the   interpretation that we're urging here is even   more naturally sort of derived from the text   than the interpretation the Court adopted in   Hayes.   And also, you know, to your -- to your   point, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, we are making   a textual argument.

We submit that that is backwards.  The                   Court should start with the governing statutory                   text, and, here, that text answers the question                   presented by putting the burden of proving                   eligibility on the alien, including a lack of                   disqualifying convictions.

Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                          First, I agree with my friend on the                   other side that this is an issue of statutory                   interpretation.  The Congress passed two                   provisions.  One uses the term \"conviction\" that                   embraces the least acts presumption, which                   Congress understood serves the important                   functions that we've discussed.                             Separately, Congress passed a burden                   of proof.  But the two are not at war.  A                  non-citizen can satisfy his burden by invoking                  the presumption, as is common in the law.  And                  the REAL ID Act did not suspend a 100-year-old                  presumption.                            Second, Justice Gorsuch asked me in                  the opening argument about the burden of                  production, and that came up in the last half                  hour.  And I would just emphasize that the                  government produced the documents here.  Page 2a                  of our blue brief has the certification of the                  immigration officer.  And that wasn't an act of                  generosity here.  That is what the government                  does in all of these cases, and that is because                  it bears the initial burden of production to                  show the existence of a conviction that, at                  least on its face, appears to be disqualifying.         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                          Section 1229a(c)(3)(B), which Justice                   Gorsuch asked me about, and subparagraph (C) as                   well, refer to \"in any proceeding under this                   chapter.\"  So it's not limited to the context in                   which the government is trying to prove                   deportability.                             As for the regulation that my friend                   on the other side mentioned, Section 1240.8(d),                   the attorney general's own interpretations of                  that regulation in the Matter of A-G-G- case and                  the Matter of S-K- case that we've cited in our                  reply show that that regulation places an                  initial burden of production on the government,                  not to speculate that a bar may apply but to                  actually make out a full prima facie case that                  the bar to relief may apply.                            Third, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked                  about some of the practicalities around                  memorializing the -- the terms of a plea.  And I                  didn't hear my friend on the other side give any                  answer to how this could work for old                  convictions, like the decades-old convictions                  that I mentioned, nor did I hear any answer to                  how exactly the criminal defendant could force                  something to be recorded in the many county and         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                state systems where this is simply checking off                   boxes on a computer program or a paper form and                   there's no opportunity to comment further.                             Finally, my friend on the other side                   mentioned efficiency concerns around allowing                   these cases to be decided at the threshold.  And                   I would just note that our rule has been in                   effect in the First Circuit since 2016, in the                   Second Circuit since 2008, and in the Ninth                  Circuit for six of the last 13 years.                            And as in the Nasrallah case last term                  when the government made a similar efficiency                  argument, it has not substantiated that by                  pointing to any actual problems arising in those                  circuits.                            The judgment should be reversed.</td>\n",

Instead, the settled understanding for   the last 45 years has been that ANCs are   eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA   purposes, even though ANCs are not and have   never been federally recognized Indian Tribes.   That interpretation has been endorsed by all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Official - Subject to Final Review    three branches of the federal government.   Congress was acting against the   backdrop of those settled understandings when it   incorporated the ISDA definition of \"Indian   Tribe\" into the CARES Act in 2020.  Congress   chose to make ANCs eligible to receive millions   of dollars of coronavirus relief funds to   benefit the many Alaska natives whom they serve.   The decision below contravenes that   policy judgment and threatens to shut ANCs out   of a wide range of important federal programs.   No sound principle of textual interpretation   justifies such a dramatic departure from the   status quo.  Reading the ISDA definition to mean   that ANCs are included only in the event that   they are someday somehow recognized by the   United States for government-to-government   relations would render their deliberate   inclusion in the statute a dead letter.  Either   the recognition clause must mean something else,   or it does not apply to ANCs.   Now we principally urge the latter   approach, which the Department of the Interior   and the Indian Health Service adopted decades   ago and which the Ninth Circuit endorsed in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Official - Subject to Final Review   Cook Inlet case.   In our view, Congress defined the   entities eligible to enter into ISDA agreements   as federally recognized Indian Tribes and also,   in addition, the entities that play a similar   role in the special case of Alaska, namely,   Alaska native villages and Alaska native   corporations defined in and established pursuant   to ANCSA. That reading, unlike Respondents'   reading, gives effect to every word and clause   in the statute.   I welcome the Court's questions.      \n",

In Hayes, the Court was   considering a statutory definition of the term   \"misdemeanor\" -- \"domestic misdemeanor violence\"   -- or, sorry, \"misdemeanor crime of domestic   violence,\" and the -- the statutory definition   there had a prefatory clause and then two   subsections, and the question before the Court   was how to apply a modifier in the second   subsection.   And based on textual and contextual   evidence, the Court concluded that the modifier   that appeared in the second subclause of that   definition actually applied to its -- its   antecedent was one of the words in the prefatory   clause at the beginning of the definition.   And we think we're asking the Court   here for -- for an even less sort of -- the   interpretation that we're urging here is even   more naturally sort of derived from the text   than the interpretation the Court adopted in   Hayes.   And also, you know, to your -- to your   point, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, we are making   a textual argument.

Petitioner's basic argument is that         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                you should start with decisions that put a gloss                   on various other statutes and retrofit this                   statute to match.                             We submit that that is backwards.  The                   Court should start with the governing statutory                   text, and, here, that text answers the question                   presented by putting the burden of proving                   eligibility on the alien, including a lack of                   disqualifying convictions.                            Now, in our view, Congress's judgment                  is compatible with this Court's precedent                  addressing the categorical and modified                  approaches, but if there were any inconsistency                  or tension, it should be resolved in favor of                  the language Congress enacted to address this                  particular issue.                            The court of appeals' decision should                  be affirmed.                               \n",

       "173    Thank you, Mr. Chief                  Justice.  I'll try to make four points quickly.         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                          First, I agree with my friend on the                   other side that this is an issue of statutory                   interpretation.  The Congress passed two                   provisions.  One uses the term \"conviction\" that                   embraces the least acts presumption, which                   Congress understood serves the important                   functions that we've discussed.                             Separately, Congress passed a burden                   of proof.  But the two are not at war.  A                  non-citizen can satisfy his burden by invoking                  the presumption, as is common in the law.  And                  the REAL ID Act did not suspend a 100-year-old                  presumption.                            Second, Justice Gorsuch asked me in                  the opening argument about the burden of                  production, and that came up in the last half                  hour.  And I would just emphasize that the                  government produced the documents here.  Page 2a                  of our blue brief has the certification of the                  immigration officer.  And that wasn't an act of                  generosity here.  That is what the government                  does in all of these cases, and that is because                  it bears the initial burden of production to                  show the existence of a conviction that, at                  least on its face, appears to be disqualifying.         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                          Section 1229a(c)(3)(B), which Justice                   Gorsuch asked me about, and subparagraph (C) as                   well, refer to \"in any proceeding under this                   chapter.\"  So it's not limited to the context in                   which the government is trying to prove                   deportability.                             As for the regulation that my friend                   on the other side mentioned, Section 1240.8(d),                   the attorney general's own interpretations of                  that regulation in the Matter of A-G-G- case and                  the Matter of S-K- case that we've cited in our                  reply show that that regulation places an                  initial burden of production on the government,                  not to speculate that a bar may apply but to                  actually make out a full prima facie case that                  the bar to relief may apply.                            Third, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked                  about some of the practicalities around                  memorializing the -- the terms of a plea.  And I                  didn't hear my friend on the other side give any                  answer to how this could work for old                  convictions, like the decades-old convictions                  that I mentioned, nor did I hear any answer to                  how exactly the criminal defendant could force                  something to be recorded in the many county and         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                state systems where this is simply checking off                   boxes on a computer program or a paper form and                   there's no opportunity to comment further.                             Finally, my friend on the other side                   mentioned efficiency concerns around allowing                   these cases to be decided at the threshold.  And                   I would just note that our rule has been in                   effect in the First Circuit since 2016, in the                   Second Circuit since 2008, and in the Ninth                  Circuit for six of the last 13 years.                            And as in the Nasrallah case last term                  when the government made a similar efficiency                  argument, it has not substantiated that by                  pointing to any actual problems arising in those                  circuits.                            The judgment should be reversed.                               \n",

       "      <td>Mr. Chief Justice, and   may it please the Court:   Our fundamental submission in this   case is that in defining \"Indian Tribe\" for ISDA   purposes, Congress did not deliberately include   Alaska native regional and village corporations   only to then exclude all of them by subjecting   them to a formal political recognition   requirement that no ANC meets or, indeed, has   ever met.   Instead, the settled understanding for   the last 45 years has been that ANCs are   eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA   purposes, even though ANCs are not and have   never been federally recognized Indian Tribes.   That interpretation has been endorsed by all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Official - Subject to Final Review    three branches of the federal government.   Congress was acting against the   backdrop of those settled understandings when it   incorporated the ISDA definition of \"Indian   Tribe\" into the CARES Act in 2020.  Congress   chose to make ANCs eligible to receive millions   of dollars of coronavirus relief funds to   benefit the many Alaska natives whom they serve.   The decision below contravenes that   policy judgment and threatens to shut ANCs out   of a wide range of important federal programs.   No sound principle of textual interpretation   justifies such a dramatic departure from the   status quo.  Reading the ISDA definition to mean   that ANCs are included only in the event that   they are someday somehow recognized by the   United States for government-to-government   relations would render their deliberate   inclusion in the statute a dead letter.  Either   the recognition clause must mean something else,   or it does not apply to ANCs.   Now we principally urge the latter   approach, which the Department of the Interior   and the Indian Health Service adopted decades   ago and which the Ninth Circuit endorsed in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Official - Subject to Final Review   Cook Inlet case.   In our view, Congress defined the   entities eligible to enter into ISDA agreements   as federally recognized Indian Tribes and also,   in addition, the entities that play a similar   role in the special case of Alaska, namely,   Alaska native villages and Alaska native   corporations defined in and established pursuant   to ANCSA. That reading, unlike Respondents'   reading, gives effect to every word and clause   in the statute.   I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

In Hayes, the Court was   considering a statutory definition of the term   \"misdemeanor\" -- \"domestic misdemeanor violence\"   -- or, sorry, \"misdemeanor crime of domestic   violence,\" and the -- the statutory definition   there had a prefatory clause and then two   subsections, and the question before the Court   was how to apply a modifier in the second   subsection.   And based on textual and contextual   evidence, the Court concluded that the modifier   that appeared in the second subclause of that   definition actually applied to its -- its   antecedent was one of the words in the prefatory   clause at the beginning of the definition.   And we think we're asking the Court   here for -- for an even less sort of -- the   interpretation that we're urging here is even   more naturally sort of derived from the text   than the interpretation the Court adopted in   Hayes.   And also, you know, to your -- to your   point, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, we are making   a textual argument.  It's not entirely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Official - Subject to Final Review   purposive. And -- and it's a text -- it's a   textual argument derived from ISDA's definition,   as well as from the other statutes that Congress   has enacted that in their text presuppose that   ANCs are eligible to be treated as Indian   Tribes.</td>\n",

Petitioner's basic argument is that         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                you should start with decisions that put a gloss                   on various other statutes and retrofit this                   statute to match.                             We submit that that is backwards.  The                   Court should start with the governing statutory                   text, and, here, that text answers the question                   presented by putting the burden of proving                   eligibility on the alien, including a lack of                   disqualifying convictions.                            Now, in our view, Congress's judgment                  is compatible with this Court's precedent                  addressing the categorical and modified                  approaches, but if there were any inconsistency                  or tension, it should be resolved in favor of                  the language Congress enacted to address this                  particular issue.

       "      <td>Thank you, Mr. Chief                  Justice.  I'll try to make four points quickly.         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                          First, I agree with my friend on the                   other side that this is an issue of statutory                   interpretation.  The Congress passed two                   provisions.  One uses the term \"conviction\" that                   embraces the least acts presumption, which                   Congress understood serves the important                   functions that we've discussed.                             Separately, Congress passed a burden                   of proof.  But the two are not at war.  A                  non-citizen can satisfy his burden by invoking                  the presumption, as is common in the law.  And                  the REAL ID Act did not suspend a 100-year-old                  presumption.                            Second, Justice Gorsuch asked me in                  the opening argument about the burden of                  production, and that came up in the last half                  hour.  And I would just emphasize that the                  government produced the documents here.  Page 2a                  of our blue brief has the certification of the                  immigration officer.  And that wasn't an act of                  generosity here.  That is what the government                  does in all of these cases, and that is because                  it bears the initial burden of production to                  show the existence of a conviction that, at                  least on its face, appears to be disqualifying.         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                          Section 1229a(c)(3)(B), which Justice                   Gorsuch asked me about, and subparagraph (C) as                   well, refer to \"in any proceeding under this                   chapter.\"  So it's not limited to the context in                   which the government is trying to prove                   deportability.                             As for the regulation that my friend                   on the other side mentioned, Section 1240.8(d),                   the attorney general's own interpretations of                  that regulation in the Matter of A-G-G- case and                  the Matter of S-K- case that we've cited in our                  reply show that that regulation places an                  initial burden of production on the government,                  not to speculate that a bar may apply but to                  actually make out a full prima facie case that                  the bar to relief may apply.                            Third, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked                  about some of the practicalities around                  memorializing the -- the terms of a plea.  And I                  didn't hear my friend on the other side give any                  answer to how this could work for old                  convictions, like the decades-old convictions                  that I mentioned, nor did I hear any answer to                  how exactly the criminal defendant could force                  something to be recorded in the many county and         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                state systems where this is simply checking off                   boxes on a computer program or a paper form and                   there's no opportunity to comment further.                             Finally, my friend on the other side                   mentioned efficiency concerns around allowing                   these cases to be decided at the threshold.  And                   I would just note that our rule has been in                   effect in the First Circuit since 2016, in the                   Second Circuit since 2008, and in the Ninth                  Circuit for six of the last 13 years.                            And as in the Nasrallah case last term                  when the government made a similar efficiency                  argument, it has not substantiated that by                  pointing to any actual problems arising in those                  circuits.                            The judgment should be reversed.</td>\n",

Instead, the settled understanding for   the last 45 years has been that ANCs are   eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA   purposes, even though ANCs are not and have   never been federally recognized Indian Tribes.   That interpretation has been endorsed by all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Official - Subject to Final Review    three branches of the federal government.   Congress was acting against the   backdrop of those settled understandings when it   incorporated the ISDA definition of \"Indian   Tribe\" into the CARES Act in 2020.  Congress   chose to make ANCs eligible to receive millions   of dollars of coronavirus relief funds to   benefit the many Alaska natives whom they serve.   The decision below contravenes that   policy judgment and threatens to shut ANCs out   of a wide range of important federal programs.   No sound principle of textual interpretation   justifies such a dramatic departure from the   status quo.  Reading the ISDA definition to mean   that ANCs are included only in the event that   they are someday somehow recognized by the   United States for government-to-government   relations would render their deliberate   inclusion in the statute a dead letter.  Either   the recognition clause must mean something else,   or it does not apply to ANCs.   Now we principally urge the latter   approach, which the Department of the Interior   and the Indian Health Service adopted decades   ago and which the Ninth Circuit endorsed in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Official - Subject to Final Review   Cook Inlet case.   In our view, Congress defined the   entities eligible to enter into ISDA agreements   as federally recognized Indian Tribes and also,   in addition, the entities that play a similar   role in the special case of Alaska, namely,   Alaska native villages and Alaska native   corporations defined in and established pursuant   to ANCSA. That reading, unlike Respondents'   reading, gives effect to every word and clause   in the statute.   I welcome the Court's questions.     \n",

In Hayes, the Court was   considering a statutory definition of the term   \"misdemeanor\" -- \"domestic misdemeanor violence\"   -- or, sorry, \"misdemeanor crime of domestic   violence,\" and the -- the statutory definition   there had a prefatory clause and then two   subsections, and the question before the Court   was how to apply a modifier in the second   subsection.   And based on textual and contextual   evidence, the Court concluded that the modifier   that appeared in the second subclause of that   definition actually applied to its -- its   antecedent was one of the words in the prefatory   clause at the beginning of the definition.   And we think we're asking the Court   here for -- for an even less sort of -- the   interpretation that we're urging here is even   more naturally sort of derived from the text   than the interpretation the Court adopted in   Hayes.   And also, you know, to your -- to your   point, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, we are making   a textual argument.

Petitioner's basic argument is that         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                you should start with decisions that put a gloss                   on various other statutes and retrofit this                   statute to match.                             We submit that that is backwards.  The                   Court should start with the governing statutory                   text, and, here, that text answers the question                   presented by putting the burden of proving                   eligibility on the alien, including a lack of                   disqualifying convictions.                            Now, in our view, Congress's judgment                  is compatible with this Court's precedent                  addressing the categorical and modified                  approaches, but if there were any inconsistency                  or tension, it should be resolved in favor of                  the language Congress enacted to address this                  particular issue.                            The court of appeals' decision should                  be affirmed.                              \n",

       "9825    Thank you, Mr. Chief                  Justice.  I'll try to make four points quickly.         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                          First, I agree with my friend on the                   other side that this is an issue of statutory                   interpretation.  The Congress passed two                   provisions.  One uses the term \"conviction\" that                   embraces the least acts presumption, which                   Congress understood serves the important                   functions that we've discussed.                             Separately, Congress passed a burden                   of proof.  But the two are not at war.  A                  non-citizen can satisfy his burden by invoking                  the presumption, as is common in the law.  And                  the REAL ID Act did not suspend a 100-year-old                  presumption.                            Second, Justice Gorsuch asked me in                  the opening argument about the burden of                  production, and that came up in the last half                  hour.  And I would just emphasize that the                  government produced the documents here.  Page 2a                  of our blue brief has the certification of the                  immigration officer.  And that wasn't an act of                  generosity here.  That is what the government                  does in all of these cases, and that is because                  it bears the initial burden of production to                  show the existence of a conviction that, at                  least on its face, appears to be disqualifying.         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                          Section 1229a(c)(3)(B), which Justice                   Gorsuch asked me about, and subparagraph (C) as                   well, refer to \"in any proceeding under this                   chapter.\"  So it's not limited to the context in                   which the government is trying to prove                   deportability.                             As for the regulation that my friend                   on the other side mentioned, Section 1240.8(d),                   the attorney general's own interpretations of                  that regulation in the Matter of A-G-G- case and                  the Matter of S-K- case that we've cited in our                  reply show that that regulation places an                  initial burden of production on the government,                  not to speculate that a bar may apply but to                  actually make out a full prima facie case that                  the bar to relief may apply.                            Third, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked                  about some of the practicalities around                  memorializing the -- the terms of a plea.  And I                  didn't hear my friend on the other side give any                  answer to how this could work for old                  convictions, like the decades-old convictions                  that I mentioned, nor did I hear any answer to                  how exactly the criminal defendant could force                  something to be recorded in the many county and         Official - Subject to Final Review                                                                                                state systems where this is simply checking off                   boxes on a computer program or a paper form and                   there's no opportunity to comment further.                             Finally, my friend on the other side                   mentioned efficiency concerns around allowing                   these cases to be decided at the threshold.  And                   I would just note that our rule has been in                   effect in the First Circuit since 2016, in the                   Second Circuit since 2008, and in the Ninth                  Circuit for six of the last 13 years.                            And as in the Nasrallah case last term                  when the government made a similar efficiency                  argument, it has not substantiated that by                  pointing to any actual problems arising in those                  circuits.                            The judgment should be reversed.                              \n",

       "      <td>Mr. Chief Justice, and   may it please the Court:   Our fundamental submission in this   case is that in defining \"Indian Tribe\" for ISDA   purposes, Congress did not deliberately include   Alaska native regional and village corporations   only to then exclude all of them by subjecting   them to a formal political recognition   requirement that no ANC meets or, indeed, has   ever met.   Instead, the settled understanding for   the last 45 years has been that ANCs are   eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA   purposes, even though ANCs are not and have   never been federally recognized Indian Tribes.   That interpretation has been endorsed by all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Official - Subject to Final Review    three branches of the federal government.   Congress was acting against the   backdrop of those settled understandings when it   incorporated the ISDA definition of \"Indian   Tribe\" into the CARES Act in 2020.  Congress   chose to make ANCs eligible to receive millions   of dollars of coronavirus relief funds to   benefit the many Alaska natives whom they serve.   The decision below contravenes that   policy judgment and threatens to shut ANCs out   of a wide range of important federal programs.   No sound principle of textual interpretation   justifies such a dramatic departure from the   status quo.  Reading the ISDA definition to mean   that ANCs are included only in the event that   they are someday somehow recognized by the   United States for government-to-government   relations would render their deliberate   inclusion in the statute a dead letter.  Either   the recognition clause must mean something else,   or it does not apply to ANCs.   Now we principally urge the latter   approach, which the Department of the Interior   and the Indian Health Service adopted decades   ago and which the Ninth Circuit endorsed in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Official - Subject to Final Review   Cook Inlet case.   In our view, Congress defined the   entities eligible to enter into ISDA agreements   as federally recognized Indian Tribes and also,   in addition, the entities that play a similar   role in the special case of Alaska, namely,   Alaska native villages and Alaska native   corporations defined in and established pursuant   to ANCSA. That reading, unlike Respondents'   reading, gives effect to every word and clause   in the statute.   I welcome the Court's questions.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Well, I think the case   that -- that we find the most instructive is the   Court's decision against -- in United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Official - Subject to Final Review    against Hayes, which is the case discussed in   our opening brief.  In Hayes, the Court was   considering a statutory definition of the term   \"misdemeanor\" -- \"domestic misdemeanor violence\"   -- or, sorry, \"misdemeanor crime of domestic   violence,\" and the -- the statutory definition   there had a prefatory clause and then two   subsections, and the question before the Court   was how to apply a modifier in the second   subsection.   And based on textual and contextual   evidence, the Court concluded that the modifier   that appeared in the second subclause of that   definition actually applied to its -- its   antecedent was one of the words in the prefatory   clause at the beginning of the definition.   And we think we're asking the Court   here for -- for an even less sort of -- the   interpretation that we're urging here is even   more naturally sort of derived from the text   than the interpretation the Court adopted in   Hayes.   And also, you know, to your -- to your   point, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, we are making   a textual argument.  It's not entirely                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Official - Subject to Final Review   purposive. And -- and it's a text -- it's a   textual argument derived from ISDA's definition,   as well as from the other statutes that Congress   has enacted that in their text presuppose that   ANCs are eligible to be treated as Indian   Tribes.</td>\n",

Mr. Guarnieri.   ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW GUARNIERI        ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN CASE NO. 20-543   MR.   \n",
       "1   Mr. Chief Justice, and   may it please the Court:   Our fundamental submission in this   case is that in defining \"Indian Tribe\" for ISDA   purposes, Congress did not deliberately include   Alaska native regional and village corporations   only to then exclude all of them by subjecting   them to a formal political recognition   requirement that no ANC meets or, indeed, has   ever met.   Instead, the settled understanding for   the last 45 years has been that ANCs are   eligible to be treated as Indian Tribes for ISDA   purposes, even though ANCs are not and have   never been federally recognized Indian Tribes.   That interpretation has been endorsed by all                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Official - Subject to Final Review    three branches of the federal government.   Congress was acting against the   backdrop of those settled understandings when it   incorporated the ISDA definition of \"Indian   Tribe\" into the CARES Act in 2020.  Congress   chose to make ANCs eligible to receive millions   of dollars of coronavirus relief funds to   benefit the many Alaska natives whom they serve.   The decision below contravenes that   policy judgment and threatens to shut ANCs out   of a wide range of important federal programs.   No sound principle of textual interpretation   justifies such a dramatic departure from the   status quo.  Reading the ISDA definition to mean   that ANCs are included only in the event that   they are someday somehow recognized by the   United States for government-to-government   relations would render their deliberate   inclusion in the statute a dead letter.  Either   the recognition clause must mean something else,   or it does not apply to ANCs.   Now we principally urge the latter   approach, which the Department of the Interior   and the Indian Health Service adopted decades   ago and which the Ninth Circuit endorsed in the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Official - Subject to Final Review   Cook Inlet case.   In our view, Congress defined the   entities eligible to enter into ISDA agreements   as federally recognized Indian Tribes and also,   in addition, the entities that play a similar   role in the special case of Alaska, namely,   Alaska native villages and Alaska native   corporations defined in and established pursuant   to ANCSA. That reading, unlike Respondents'   reading, gives effect to every word and clause   in the statute.   I welcome the Court's questions.     \n",

In Hayes, the Court was   considering a statutory definition of the term   \"misdemeanor\" -- \"domestic misdemeanor violence\"   -- or, sorry, \"misdemeanor crime of domestic   violence,\" and the -- the statutory definition   there had a prefatory clause and then two   subsections, and the question before the Court   was how to apply a modifier in the second   subsection.   And based on textual and contextual   evidence, the Court concluded that the modifier   that appeared in the second subclause of that   definition actually applied to its -- its   antecedent was one of the words in the prefatory   clause at the beginning of the definition.   And we think we're asking the Court   here for -- for an even less sort of -- the   interpretation that we're urging here is even   more naturally sort of derived from the text   than the interpretation the Court adopted in   Hayes.   And also, you know, to your -- to your   point, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean, we are making   a textual argument.
