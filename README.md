## Process

$ Scrape all of the necessary information from: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2021. This should result in a list of dictionaries for each case.
$ Scrape circut for each case: https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/ordersbycircuit/ordercasebycircuit/061118OrderCasesByCircuit
$ Clean up all the text files. In the end you want to have a separate list for each case that contains the speaker and the dialogue attached to that speaker.
