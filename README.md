# Mapping Supremcourt Cases By Aggreeable and Disagreeable Language

Final project for Data and Databases class at Columbia Journalism School. 

## Process

* Scrape all of the necessary information from: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2021. This should result in a list of dictionaries for each case.

* Scrape circut for each case: https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/ordersbycircuit/ordercasebycircuit/061118OrderCasesByCircuit

* Clean up all the text files. In the end you want to have a separate list for each case that contains the speaker and the dialogue attached to that speaker.
